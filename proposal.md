# Big Idea

## Main Idea
We would like to create a customizable “Choose your own adventure” quiz that helps people figure out their career aspirations after graduating college. As current upperclassmen, we wanted to create a tool that would help solve the question that a lot of people ask themselves: “what will I do after graduation?” 

After answering 10-15 questions about work styles and preferences, users will receive a notification telling them about their results. A few examples of potential questions could be:
If you are posed with [insert problem/ task], how would you solve it?
Out of these potential lifestyles, which one do you want to have after graduation?
Out of these office layouts, which one inspires you the most?


Our objective would be that not only is it informative, but that it is also interactive and engaging for the user. 


## Topics to Explore

A few topics that we will explore will be:
Components that make up a career (location, type of office, working hours, co-workers, work environment, data driven versus creative mind, etc.)
The steps on how to create a “quiz-type” project with Python. For instance, we would explore how to incorporate a variety of data forms (ie: text, written responses, images, etc.) and generate connections between the variety of choices selected to provide a realistic answer.

Accomplish: Based on choices selected by players, they will have a better understanding of what career choice they are best suited for. 


**Goal:** Based on the choices selected by players, they will gain a better understanding of the career path best suited to them.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and Stretch Goal

Our MVP is a little story guide that allows for people to answer questions and can help people understand what they would be good at and choose their careers accordingly. Our stretch goal is to help people find their utter dream job.

## Learning Objectives

### Individual Goals

Sneha wishes to learn how to connect design and python into something meaningful. Similarly, Sol would like to create an interesting project that can genuinely help people program their life. Additionally, Sol would like to get a deeper understanding of how Python can integrate with front-end tools to make usable and practical tools. 

### Shared Goals

Since our individual goals overlap, our shared goals are mainly the same. For example, we want to make a positive impact in a community that can be very collaborative, but also cutthroat. Therefore, if our project is able to help at least one person, then we will be content. On the technical side, we would like to perform well grade-wise, but mainly focus on applying concepts learned during class and making our vision come to life. An added benefit would be if we could use the assignment as a project portfolio piece. 

## Implementation Plan

We plan to utilize several APIs for our implementation. One of the main resources will be the O*NET Web Services, a free API that offers detailed information on over 1,000 occupations, including required skills and work styles. Since the data is sourced from the U.S. Department of Labor, we can rely on real-time job information. This API serves as a comprehensive resource for our needs. Additionally, we intend to use the Unsplash API, or a similar service, for acquiring images. We will also leverage HTML and CSS for the design aspect of our project. Given the project's broad scope, we will explore AI, conduct online research, and review other projects to gain valuable insights and direction.


## Project Schedule

The duration of this project will be just under one month. Our initial phase will involve research and the development of engaging questions that will be both enjoyable for users and informative for drawing conclusions. We will validate our ideas by writing code statements that pull data from the APIs, displaying the results in the console using Visual Studio Code. Following this, we will begin the design phase of our application. We will use HTML and CSS to bring our design concepts to life, after which we will integrate our Python code with the CSS, creating a cohesive application.

## Collaboration Plan

To ensure that we collaborate as teammates on this project, we will set up a fixed, weekly meeting time. Meanwhile, our main form of communication will be through Slack and WhatsApp. In our group chats, we will consider each other’s opinions with respect and provide feedback on a topic if requested. Moreover, since we will be co-programming the project together, we will be proactive with our updates.

## Task Division

Depending on the type of task, we will do them separately or together. For example, on this Project Proposal Assignment, we are working together at the same time on a shared google document. However, if there are coding aspects that can be done independently, we will most likely divide the tasks and combine them together at our weekly meetings.  

## Comprehensive Pair Programming

We will not be undertaking a comprehensive pair program unless required by the code. Pair programming entails that Sneha and I would be coding together on the same computer. Considering that we both have busy schedules, it would be inefficient to only work on our program together. Therefore, we will divide the tasks and once completed, combine them in person to ensure that the code runs smoothly. However, in the case that the code can only be written on one computer, we are more than happy to find time to make it possible. At that point, one person will be the “driver” of the task, while the other person will be the “navigator,” and vice versa.

## Effective Team Collaboration Plan

To ensure effective team collaboration, we will set up a weekly meeting to focus on working collaboratively and effectively. Beforehand, we will assign each other “to-dos” to complete before the meeting (tasks can include brainstorming, researching, and coding).

## Software Development Methodologies

We anticipate using the Agile Development Methodology because it is a well-rounded strategy that ensures the quality of our assignment. Although this methodology requires a bigger time commitment and various rounds of feedback, it would allow us to revisit the project from various angles to continuously improve it. 

## Risks and Limitations

This project faces several risks and limitations, both logistically and personally. From a project standpoint, we are concerned that the volume of data may become overwhelming, which could hinder our development process. Additionally, we worry that the results of our quiz may not align with users' expectations, rendering our project ineffective. On a personal level, we often struggle with meeting deadlines, as we both focus too much on the ideation phase which takes time away from implementation. Furthermore, our busy schedules are filled with intensive classes and extracurricular activities. Regardless of these challenges, we are both passionate about this project and will strive to make it as successful as possible!

## Additional Course Content

The additional course content included various topics such as functions, web applications, and API integration. Moreover, we would benefit from implementing while loops and for loops, as well as CSS and HTML concepts. And lastly, we are interested in discovering additional online resources that explain how to program online quizzes and create choose-your-own-adventure storylines.
