# Big Idea

## Main Idea
We would like to create a customizable “Choose your own adventure” quiz that helps people figure out their career aspirations after graduating college. As current upperclassmen, we wanted to create a tool that would help solve the question that a lot of people ask themselves: “What will I do after graduation?”

After answering 10–15 questions about work styles and preferences, users will receive a notification telling them about their results. A few examples of potential questions could be:

- If you are posed with [insert problem/task], how would you solve it?
- Out of these potential lifestyles, which one do you want to have after graduation?
- Out of these office layouts, which one inspires you the most?

Our objective is to make this not only informative but also interactive and engaging for the user.

## Topics to Explore

A few topics that we will explore include:

- Components that make up a career (location, type of office, working hours, co-workers, work environment, data-driven vs. creative mindset, etc.)
- How to create a quiz-style project using Python.
- How to incorporate various data forms (text, images, written responses) and generate connections between user selections to provide meaningful results.

**Goal:** Based on the choices selected by players, they will gain a better understanding of the career path best suited to them.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and Stretch Goal

- **MVP:** A guided quiz or interactive story that helps users understand what they’re good at and which careers might align with their preferences.
- **Stretch Goal:** Helping users identify their dream job and how to reach it.

---

## Learning Objectives

### Individual Goals

- **Sneha:** Learn how to connect design and Python in a meaningful way.
- **Sol:** Create an engaging project that helps people "program" their life, and gain a deeper understanding of how Python can integrate with front-end tools.

### Shared Goals

Since our individual goals align closely, our shared goals are:

- Make a positive impact in a community that can be collaborative but also competitive.
- Apply class concepts effectively.
- Create a finished project we’re proud of and potentially include it in a personal portfolio.

---

## Implementation Plan

We plan to utilize several APIs:

- **O\*NET Web Services**: Free API with detailed information on over 1,000 occupations, including skills and work styles (from the U.S. Department of Labor).
- **Unsplash API**: For visual elements (images that complement story/quiz flow).
- **HTML + CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **Python**: For logic and decision trees.

We’ll also explore AI tools, research similar projects, and consider using frameworks for quiz logic and flow design.

---

## Project Schedule

The duration of the project will be just under one month:

1. **Week 1**: Research & question development.
2. **Week 2**: API integration + testing output via Visual Studio Code.
3. **Week 3**: Begin front-end design using HTML/CSS.
4. **Week 4**: Final integration and user testing.

---

## Collaboration Plan

- Weekly scheduled meetings.
- Communication via Slack and WhatsApp.
- Open collaboration and respectful feedback.
- Co-programming where appropriate, but also dividing tasks to work independently and combine later.

---

## Task Division

- Collaborative work on project proposals and brainstorming.
- Independent work on modular coding tasks.
- Merge and test code during meetings.

---

## Comprehensive Pair Programming

We will only pair program if absolutely necessary for specific sections. If needed, one of us will act as the “driver” and the other as the “navigator,” switching roles as appropriate.

---

## Effective Team Collaboration Plan

- Weekly sync meetings with pre-assigned “to-dos.”
- Use checklists to ensure progress (research, coding, design).

---

## Software Development Methodologies

We’ll use the **Agile Development Methodology**, which allows for iteration and feedback. This will help us:

- Break the project into sprints.
- Revisit sections for improvements.
- Ensure continuous progress and a polished final product.

---

## Risks and Limitations

**Project Risks:**
- Overwhelming volume of data.
- Results might not meet user expectations.

**Personal Risks:**
- Time management issues.
- Getting stuck in ideation.
- Busy academic and extracurricular schedules.

Despite these risks, we’re highly motivated and excited to bring this project to life.

---

## Additional Course Content

We’ll apply and explore:
- Functions and control structures (if, while, for loops)
- Web applications and API integration
- HTML/CSS styling
- Online tutorials on building quizzes and interactive stories

We’re also interested in discovering tools for branching narratives and user-based decision trees.
