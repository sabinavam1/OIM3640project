## Goal

The purpose of this tool is to help guide college students about the career choice that suits their skills the most. Our project is a quiz that asks users a series of questions about their career preferences, personality traits, and life goals. Based on their responses, the quiz will suggest a career that checks off their requisites. As upperclassmen ourselves, we wanted to create a tool that would help solve the question that a lot of people ask themselves, which is "what will I do after graduation?"

## User Instructions

Users will respond to ten "out-of-the-box" questions. Every question will be multiple choice with an average of four options per question. A few examples are the following:

  1. You wake up and you’re a duck. What’s the first thing you do?
     - Apply for a business loan
     - Start a cult
     - Fly south and write poetry
     - Conduct a controlled science experiment in the pond

  3. Pick a method to overthrow a small government.
     - A really well-designed PowerPoint
     - Meme warfare
     - Slow infiltration via internships
     - Mind control through baked goods

Although the majority of the questions will consist in selecting option a, b, c, and d.

After the ten questions, users will get a notification saying "You're ideal career will be... (insert career name)!"

## Project Evolution/Narrative

In the beginning, our idea was to create a "choose your own adventure" project, where the user could decide the next action a character could take based on the events of the story. Then, we transitioned into the "career quiz." Overall, the project went smoothly, even though there were moments when our Githubs weren't working, we accidentally leaked our APIs, and we struggled deciding on our website aesthetic. However, we eventually made it work.
