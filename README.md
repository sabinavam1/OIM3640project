## Big Idea/Goal/Why did we do this?

The purpose of this tool is to help guide college students about the career choice that suits their skills the most. Our project is a quiz that asks users a series of questions about their career preferences, personality traits, and life goals. Based on their responses, the quiz will suggest a career that checks off their requisites. As upperclassmen ourselves, we wanted to create a tool that would help solve the question that a lot of people ask themselves, which is "what will I do after graduation?"

## User Instructions/README

Users will respond to ten "out-of-the-box" questions. Every quesiton will be multiple choice with an average of four options per question. A few examples are the following:

  1. You wake up and you’re a duck. What’s the first thing you do?
     - Apply for a business loan
     - Start a cult
     - Fly south and write poetry
     - Conduct a controlled science experiment in the pond

  3. Pick a method to overthrow a small government.
     - A really well-designed PowerPoint
     - Meme warfare
     - Slow infiltration via internships
     - Mind control through baked goods

Although the majority of the questions will consist in selecting option a, b, c, and d, there will be questions where users will have to click on images instead.

After the ten questions, users will get a notification saying "You're ideal career will be... (insert career name)!"
